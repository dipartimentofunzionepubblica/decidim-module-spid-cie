        # e.g. in the following situation:
        #
        # - The user registered to the service through OmniAuth for the first

        # - They go to the authorization view to authorize themselves through
        #   MSAD (which adds the authorization metadata information that might
        #   be required in order to perform actions).

        #   different user profiles (which could lead to thefts).
